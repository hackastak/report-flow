# EXPECTED RESULT:
# - You should see orders with financial data
# - The transactions field should be populated
# - If this works but ReportFlow doesn't, the issue is the date range calculation

# NEXT STEP:
# If this query returns orders, then the problem is that ReportFlow's "Last 30 Days"
# calculation doesn't match the dates when your orders were created.
#
# Solution: Use "Last 90 Days" or "Custom" date range in ReportFlow
