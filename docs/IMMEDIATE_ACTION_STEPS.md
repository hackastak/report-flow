# Immediate Action Steps to Fix Empty Report

## The Most Likely Issue

Looking at your Shopify Finance Summary screenshot, I notice it shows:
- **Date Range:** "Sep 5 - Oct 5, 2025"
- **Label:** "Last 30 days"

This suggests your test orders were created around **September 5, 2025**.

However, ReportFlow calculates "Last 30 Days" as:
- **Start:** Today minus 29 days
- **End:** Today

**If today is October 6 or later, your September 5 orders would be OUTSIDE the "Last 30 Days" window!**

## Quick Fix: Test with a Wider Date Range

### Option 1: Use "Last 90 Days"
1. In ReportFlow, go to Finance Summary
2. Change date range to **"Last 90 Days"**
3. Run the report
4. This should capture your September orders

### Option 2: Use Custom Date Range
1. In ReportFlow, go to Finance Summary
2. Select **"Custom"** date range
3. Set:
   - Start Date: **September 1, 2025**
   - End Date: **October 31, 2025**
4. Run the report
5. This will definitely include your test orders

## Verify the Issue

### Step 1: Check Today's Date
What is today's date? If it's October 6 or later, then "Last 30 Days" would be:
- Start: ~September 7 or later
- End: Today

Your September 5 orders would be excluded!

### Step 2: Test in GraphQL Explorer

Go to: `https://[your-store].myshopify.com/admin/api/graphql/explorer.html`

Paste this query:

```graphql
query CheckOrderDates {
  orders(first: 10, reverse: true) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        createdAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Look at the `createdAt` dates. Are they within the last 30 days from today?

### Step 3: Test with Exact Date Range from Shopify

Shopify shows "Sep 5 - Oct 5, 2025". Test with this exact range:

```graphql
query TestShopifyDateRange {
  orders(
    first: 250
    query: "created_at:>='2025-09-05T00:00:00Z' AND created_at<='2025-10-05T23:59:59Z'"
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        createdAt
        totalPriceSet {
          shopMoney {
            amount
            currencyCode
          }
        }
        transactions {
          id
          kind
          status
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If this returns orders, then the issue is definitely the date range calculation.

## Permanent Fix: Adjust Date Range

If the issue is that your test orders are slightly older than 30 days, you have two options:

### Option A: Create New Test Orders
1. Go to Shopify Admin
2. Create a few new test orders TODAY
3. Then run the Finance Summary report for "Last 30 Days"
4. Should work!

### Option B: Adjust the Date Range Logic
If you want "Last 30 Days" to match Shopify's definition exactly, we might need to adjust the calculation.

Shopify's "Last 30 days" might be:
- Start: 30 days ago (not 29)
- Or: Start of day 30 days ago

Let me know if you want me to adjust this.

## What to Do Right Now

1. **Try "Last 90 Days"** in ReportFlow - this should work immediately
2. **Check the terminal logs** when you run the report (look for the console.log messages I added)
3. **Test the GraphQL query** in the explorer to see what dates your orders have
4. **Share the results** with me:
   - Did "Last 90 Days" return data?
   - What dates do your test orders have?
   - What do the terminal logs show?

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue and provide the right fix!
