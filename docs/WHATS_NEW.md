# What's New - All Channels Feature

## 🎉 New Feature: "All Channels" Option

### What It Does:
The Sales Channel filter now includes an **"All Channels"** option that fetches data from all sales channels without filtering.

### Why It Matters:
- ✅ **More accurate reports** - No more missing orders from unexpected channels
- ✅ **Better defaults** - New reports automatically include all orders
- ✅ **Prevents empty reports** - Users won't get 0 results because their orders are from unlisted channels
- ✅ **Still flexible** - Users can still filter by specific channels if needed

### What Changed:

#### Before:
```
Sales Channel: [Online Store] [POS] [Mobile] [Facebook] [Instagram]
```
- Had to select specific channels
- Orders from other channels (Admin, Draft Orders, API) were excluded
- Could result in empty reports

#### After:
```
Sales Channel: [All Channels ✓] [Online Store] [POS] [Mobile] [Facebook] [Instagram]
```
- **"All Channels" is selected by default**
- Includes orders from ALL channels (Admin, Draft Orders, API, etc.)
- Can still select specific channels if needed

### Reports Affected:
- 💰 **Sales Report**
- 📈 **Traffic Report**
- 💵 **Finance Summary Report**

### How to Use:

#### For New Reports:
1. Create a new report
2. **"All Channels" is already selected** - just leave it as is!
3. Run the report - it will include all orders

#### For Existing Reports:
**Option 1: Migrate all reports to "All Channels"**
```bash
node migrate-sales-channel-to-all.js
```

**Option 2: Edit individual reports**
1. Go to Scheduled Reports
2. Click "Edit" on a report
3. In Sales Channel filter, select "All Channels"
4. Save

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Finance Summary (All Channels)
```
Sales Channel: [All Channels ✓]
Date Range: Last 30 Days
```
**Result:** Fetches all orders from the last 30 days, regardless of channel

#### Example 2: Sales Report (Specific Channels)
```
Sales Channel: [Online Store ✓] [POS ✓]
Date Range: Last 7 Days
```
**Result:** Fetches only orders from Online Store and POS from the last 7 days

### Technical Details:

**When "All Channels" is selected:**
- No channel filter is added to the GraphQL query
- Query: `created_at:>='...' AND created_at:<='...'`
- Fetches orders from ALL channels

**When specific channels are selected:**
- Channel filter is added to the GraphQL query
- Query: `created_at:>='...' AND created_at:<='...' AND (online_store OR pos)`
- Fetches only orders from selected channels

### Migration:

If you have existing reports with specific sales channel filters, you can migrate them:

```bash
node migrate-sales-channel-to-all.js
```

This will update all reports to use "All Channels" by default.
