## Executive Summary

Report Flow is a Shopify App that automates analytics report generation and delivery. It eliminates the manual process of viewing reports, exporting data, renaming files, and emailing them to stakeholders. Users can select report types, configure filters, schedule automatic delivery, and have reports sent via email to multiple recipients.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Manual Process:** Merchants must manually access Shopify admin, navigate to reports, apply filters, export data, and email files
2. **Time-Consuming:** This process takes 10-15 minutes per report and must be repeated daily/weekly/monthly
3. **Error-Prone:** Manual processes lead to forgotten reports, incorrect filters, or missed recipients
4. **No Automation:** Shopify doesn't provide built-in scheduled report delivery
5. **Stakeholder Communication:** Sharing data with team members requires manual coordination

### Target Users

- **Primary:** Shopify store owners and managers
- **Secondary:** Finance teams, marketing teams, operations managers
- **Tertiary:** External stakeholders (accountants, consultants, investors)

---

## Product Vision

**Vision Statement:** Automate Shopify analytics reporting so merchants can focus on growing their business instead of manually generating and distributing reports.

**Mission:** Provide a simple, reliable, and flexible solution for scheduled report delivery that saves time and ensures stakeholders always have the data they need.
