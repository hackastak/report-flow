## Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Critical Fixes

#### 1. Filter Parsing Error (October 5, 2025)
**Issue:** Filters stored as JSON strings weren't parsed back to arrays/objects
**Fix:** Added JSON.parse() in report execution service
**Impact:** All report types now work correctly with complex filters

#### 2. GraphQL Client Initialization (October 5, 2025)
**Issue:** Admin GraphQL client wasn't properly created for background jobs
**Fix:** Implemented proper session loading and client initialization
**Impact:** Both manual and scheduled executions now work reliably

#### 3. Sales Channel Filter (October 5, 2025)
**Issue:** Reports returned empty results when orders were from unexpected channels
**Fix:** Added "All Channels" option as default, removed restrictive filtering
**Impact:** Reports now include all orders by default, preventing empty results

#### 4. Finance Summary Transactions (October 5, 2025)
**Issue:** GraphQL query had incorrect field structure for transactions
**Fix:** Corrected transaction field structure in query
**Impact:** Finance Summary now includes payment gateway fees

#### 5. Timezone Handling (October 5, 2025)
**Issue:** Date calculations didn't account for user timezone
**Fix:** Implemented comprehensive timezone helper with UTC conversion
**Impact:** Reports now respect merchant's timezone for date ranges

### Performance Improvements
- ‚úÖ Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- ‚úÖ Exponential backoff for API rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- ‚úÖ Efficient GraphQL queries to minimize API calls
- ‚úÖ Temporary file cleanup to prevent storage bloat

### Security Enhancements
- ‚úÖ Shop-based data isolation
- ‚úÖ Input validation on all user inputs
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- ‚úÖ XSS prevention via React
- ‚úÖ Secure session management
- ‚úÖ Environment variable security

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Service-Oriented Architecture
**Decision:** Separate business logic into distinct service modules
**Rationale:** Maintainability, testability, reusability, scalability

### 2. React Router v7
**Decision:** Use React Router instead of Express.js
**Rationale:** Unified codebase, type safety, modern DX, Shopify integration

### 3. Prisma ORM
**Decision:** Use Prisma for database access
**Rationale:** Type safety, migration management, intuitive API, database agnostic

### 4. node-cron Scheduler
**Decision:** Use node-cron instead of external job queue
**Rationale:** Simplicity, cost-effective, sufficient for use case, easy deployment

### 5. SMTP Email Delivery
**Decision:** Use nodemailer with SMTP
**Rationale:** Flexibility, cost control, privacy, reliability, attachment support

### 6. Finance Summary Calculation
**Decision:** Calculate from order data instead of using ShopifyQL
**Rationale:** ShopifyQL is in closed beta, order-based is standard approach, provides same data

### 7. Custom Reports Implementation
**Decision:** Dynamic field selection with GraphQL path mapping
**Rationale:** Maximum flexibility, no hardcoded limitations, user-driven customization

### 8. Starter Reports vs Templates
**Decision:** Provide full-featured starter reports
**Rationale:** Users want quick start, not configuration; reduces onboarding friction
