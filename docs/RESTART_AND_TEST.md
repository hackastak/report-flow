# How to Restart and Test the Fix (Updated)

## Step 1: Stop the Current Server

In your terminal where the dev server is running:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
2. Wait for it to fully shut down

## Step 2: Restart the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait for the server to fully start. You should see:
```
Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000
```

## Step 3: Run the Finance Summary Report

1. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Navigate to your Finance Summary report
3. Make sure it's set to "Last 30 Days"
4. Click "Run Now"

## Step 4: Check the Terminal Logs

You should now see **NEW DEBUG LOGS** with an execution ID like this:

```
========== [Finance Summary abc123] START ==========
[Finance Summary abc123] Received filters: { ... }
[Finance Summary abc123] After calculateDateRange:
  startDate.toISOString() = 2025-09-07T00:00:00.000Z
  endDate.toISOString() = 2025-10-06T23:59:59.999Z
[Finance Summary abc123] After storing in variables:
  startDateISO = 2025-09-07T00:00:00.000Z
  endDateISO = 2025-10-06T23:59:59.999Z
[Finance Summary abc123] After building query:
  queryFilter = created_at:>='2025-09-07T00:00:00.000Z' AND created_at<='2025-10-06T23:59:59.999Z'
========== [Finance Summary abc123] QUERY BUILT ==========

[Finance Summary abc123] About to execute GraphQL query with:
  queryFilter = created_at:>='2025-09-07T00:00:00.000Z' AND created_at<='2025-10-06T23:59:59.999Z'
  cursor = null
[Finance Summary abc123] Page 1: Fetched 10 orders
[Finance Summary abc123] Total orders fetched: 10
```

## What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs:
- All logs have the **same execution ID** (e.g., `abc123`)
- Start date is `00:00:00.000Z` (midnight UTC)
- End date is `23:59:59.999Z` (end of day UTC)
- **All date values are consistent** across all log lines
- The `queryFilter` in "After building query" matches the one in "About to execute GraphQL"
- Orders are fetched (should see "Total orders fetched: 10")

### ❌ Bad Signs:
- Different execution IDs mixed together (means multiple executions are overlapping)
- Dates change between log lines (e.g., Sept 7 becomes Oct 6)
- Start date is `08:00:00.000Z` or `05:00:00.000Z` (timezone issue)
- Query filter dates don't match the stored variables
- No orders fetched (means date range is still wrong)

## If You Still See No Orders

If the dates look correct but you still see 0 orders, check:

1. **Order timestamps**: Make sure your orders were created within the date range
2. **Sales channel filter**: Make sure the filter includes the channel your orders were created on
3. **GraphQL query**: Check if there are any other filters being applied

## Expected Result

After the fix, you should:
1. ✅ See 10 orders fetched
2. ✅ Receive an email with a CSV file
3. ✅ CSV contains financial data for your orders

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Share the **complete terminal output** from the report execution, including:
- The execution ID
- All logs with that execution ID
- Any error messages

This will help me identify what's going wrong!
