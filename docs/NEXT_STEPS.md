# Next Steps to Debug Finance Summary

## What We Know So Far

✅ You have orders in your dev store (10 orders from October 5, 2025)
✅ The GraphQL API can fetch these orders
✅ The orders are within the "Last 30 Days" range
❌ ReportFlow is returning an empty CSV

## What We Need to Find Out

We need to see what's happening when ReportFlow runs the report. I've added detailed logging to help us debug.

## Steps to Debug

### Step 1: Restart Your Dev Server

The new logging code needs to be loaded:

```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Run the Finance Summary Report

1. Go to ReportFlow in your browser
2. Find your Finance Summary report
3. Make sure it's set to "Last 30 Days"
4. Click "Run Now"

### Step 3: Check Terminal Logs

You should see output like this in your terminal:

```
[Report Execution] Manual execution requested for <report-id>
[Report Execution] Starting report <report-id>
[Report Execution] Created history record: <history-id>
[Report Execution] Fetching data from Shopify...
[Report Execution] Filters: {
  "dateRange": "LAST_30_DAYS"
}
[Finance Summary] Received filters: {
  "dateRange": "LAST_30_DAYS"
}
[Finance Summary] Date Range: 2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z to 2025-10-05T23:59:59.999Z
[Finance Summary] Query Filter: created_at:>='2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z' AND created_at:<='2025-10-05T23:59:59.999Z'
[Finance Summary] Page 1: Fetched X orders
[Finance Summary] Total orders fetched: X
[Report Execution] Fetched X records
[Report Execution] Processing data...
[Report Execution] Generated CSV: <file-path>
[Report Execution] Processed X records
```

### Step 4: Copy and Share the Logs

**Please copy the entire terminal output** from when you clicked "Run Now" until the report completes, and share it with me.

Pay special attention to:
- What filters are being passed?
- What date range is calculated?
- How many orders are fetched?
- How many records are processed?

### Step 5: Test the GraphQL Query

While we wait, also test this query in the GraphQL Explorer:

File: `TEST_FINANCE_QUERY_WITH_DATE_FILTER.graphql`

This will tell us if the query itself works when run directly against Shopify's API.

## What We're Looking For

### Scenario 1: No Orders Fetched
If the logs show `Total orders fetched: 0`, then the issue is with the GraphQL query or date range.

**Possible causes:**
- Date range calculation is wrong
- Query syntax is incorrect
- Timezone issue

### Scenario 2: Orders Fetched But Empty CSV
If the logs show `Total orders fetched: 10` but `Processed 0 records`, then the issue is in the data processing logic.

**Possible causes:**
- Data transformation error
- Filter logic removing all records
- CSV generation issue

### Scenario 3: Orders Fetched and Processed But Empty Email
If the logs show both fetched and processed records, but the CSV is empty, then the issue is with the CSV file itself.

**Possible causes:**
- File path issue
- CSV formatting error
- File not being attached to email

## Quick Tests You Can Do Now

### Test 1: GraphQL Query with Date Filter

Run `TEST_FINANCE_QUERY_WITH_DATE_FILTER.graphql` in the GraphQL Explorer.

**Expected:** Should return your 10 orders from October 5.

### Test 2: Check Your Report Configuration

In ReportFlow:
1. Go to your Finance Summary report
2. Check the filters - what date range is selected?
3. Check if there are any other filters applied

### Test 3: Try Different Date Ranges

Try running the report with:
- "Today" - Should definitely include October 5 orders
- "Last 90 Days" - Should include everything
- "Custom" with September 1 - October 31

If any of these return data, we know it's a date range issue.

## Once We Have the Logs

Based on what the logs show, we'll be able to:

1. **Identify the exact problem** - Is it fetching, processing, or formatting?
2. **Fix the root cause** - Not just a workaround
3. **Test the fix** - Make sure it works for all date ranges
4. **Verify with your data** - Confirm the Finance Summary matches Shopify's

## Questions to Answer

When you share the logs, also let me know:

1. What date range did you select in ReportFlow?
2. Did you receive an email with the CSV?
3. If yes, was the CSV empty or did it have data?
4. What does the GraphQL test query return?

This will help us pinpoint the exact issue and fix it quickly!
